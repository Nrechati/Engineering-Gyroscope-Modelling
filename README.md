# Engineering study : Gyroscope Modelling

This project is the review of my work upon a **5th Year Assignement** as en engineering student at **ESTACA**

## Disclaimer

This Project on Github is still a work in progress. I am currently getting files and will update all along with this README to be able to show this work in a more understable way

> Sadly as i'm french and was in a french engineering school, my project report and a lot of files here are written in french as asked by the assignement. I'll document this here, via the project README, in english hoping you at least get a grasp of this project.

## How to run

- Just `Make`
