# Engineering study : Gyroscope Modelling

This project is homemade **HashMap** lib written in **C**

This was first implemented as a ressources in my [42sh]([https://github.com/Nrechati/42sh](https://github.com/Nrechati/42sh)) project. The idea was to implement a first **generic, scalable, easy to use, "black box" library**, while still maintaining acceptable **performance** and a **low collision rate**. The goal was also to introduce myself to this strong data structure by coding one from scratch my self.

>  **Note** : 42 also forbid us to use standard lib in almost every case. Thus recoding this design pattern from scratch was my only way to use it in a school project.

## How to run

- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Nrechati/HashMap.git`
